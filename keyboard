# The following variables describe your keyboard and can have the same
# values as the XkbModel, XkbLayout, XkbVariant and XkbOptions options
# in /usr/share/doc/keyboard-configuration/xorg.lst

XKBMODEL="pc105"
XKBLAYOUT="us"
XKBVARIANT="dvorak"
XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:swap_lwin_lctl"

# If you don't want to use the XKB layout on the console, you can
# specify an alternative keymap.  Make sure it will be accessible
# before /usr is mounted.
# KMAP=/etc/console-setup/defkeymap.kmap.gz

# If you're using Xubuntu, run following commands to apply changes.
#
# cp ./keyboard /etc/default/keyboard
# sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
